    "# Investigating Fandango Movie Ratings\n",
    "***\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In October 2015, a data journalist named Walt Hickey analyzed movie ratings data and found strong evidence to suggest that Fandango's rating system was biased and dishonest ([Fandango](https://www.fandango.com) is an online movie ratings aggregator and movie ticket seller). He published his full analysis in [this article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/fandango-movies-ratings/). According to Walt's analysis, there's a significant discrepancy between the number of stars displayed to users and the actual rating, which he was able to find in the HTML of the page. He was able to find that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The actual rating was almost always **rounded up** to the nearest half-star. For instance, a 4.1 movie would be rounded off to 4.5 stars, not to 4 stars, as you may expect.\n",
    "- In the case of 8% of the ratings analyzed, the rounding up was done to the nearest whole star. For instance, a 4.5 rating would be rounded off to 5 stars.\n",
    "- For one movie rating, the rounding off was completely bizarre: from a rating of 4 in the HTML of the page to a displayed rating of 5 stars.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Fandango displayed a 5-star rating system on their website, where the minimum rating is 0 stars and the maximum is 5 stars.\n",
    "![Fandango Age of Ultron Ratings](Fandango_Age_of_Ultron.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "At the time of this writing (2021), Fandango no longer publishes their own movie rating, instead, they now only show Rotten Tomatoes' ratings in their website.\n",
    "![Fandango Dune Ratings](Fandango_Dune.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The graphs below shows that Fandango's movie ratings distribution are strongly skewed left and there's no rating under 2 stars in the sample Hickey analyzed. This suggests that movie ratings on Fandango were generally high compared to other competitors.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Fandango Inflated Ratings](Fandango_Inflated_Ratings.png)\n",
    "Source: *[Be Suspicious Of Online Movie Ratings, Especially Fandangoâ€™s](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/fandango-movies-ratings/)*\n",
    "\n",
    "When Hickey asked Fandango about its rounding practice, e.g. 4.1 is rounded to 4.5, Fandango's officials replied that the biased rounding off was caused by a bug in their system rather than being intentional, and they promised to fix the bug as soon as possible. Presumably, this has already happened, although we can't tell for sure since the actual rating value doesn't seem to be displayed anymore in the pages' HTML.\n",
    "***\n",
    "## Goal\n",
    "In this project, we'll analyze more recent movie ratings data to determine whether there has been any change in Fandango's rating system after Hickey's analysis.\n",
    "*** \n",
    "## Data\n",
    "We'll work with two samples of movie ratings:the data in one sample was collected previous to Hickey's analysis, while the other sample was collected after. Let's start by reading in the two samples (which are stored as CSV files) and getting familiar with their structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Walt Hickey made the data he analyzed publicly available on [GitHub](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/fandango). We'll use the data he collected to analyze the characteristics of Fandango's rating system previous to his analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- One of Dataquest's team members collected movie ratings data for movies released in 2016 and 2017. The data is publicly available on [Github](https://github.com/mircealex/Movie_ratings_2016_17) and we'll use it to analyze the rating system's characteristics after Hickey's analysis.\n",
    "***\n",
    "## Analysis\n",
    "First, we import all the necessary libaries and read all csv files into dataframe."
